    > - **Damsel** -- All Minions know you are in play. If a Minion publicly guesses you (once), your team loses.
    > - **Barber** -- If you died today or tonight, the Demon may choose 2 players (not another Demon) to swap characters.
    
    __Minions__
    > - **Witch** -- Each night, choose a player: if they nominate tomorrow, they die. If just 3 players live, you lose this ability.
    > - **Spy** -- Each night, you see the Grimoire. You might register as good & as a Townsfolk or Outsider, even if dead.

    > - **Spy / Magician** - When the Spy sees the Grimoire, the Demon and Magician's character tokens are removed.

    > - **Snake Charmer** - On the first night, the snake charmer will pick before evil info.
    > - **Fang Gu / Monk** - An Outsider chosen by the Monk cannot be jumped to.
